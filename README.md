Fetch Rewards Test for Interview


1. Used Postman to look at model data for theMealDb.com API
2. Made some whiteboard sketches on a notepad of how I was going to layout the app design, based on the instructions given to me
3. Created the app layout on storyboard and connected everything to each other in their proper place in the viewcontrollers/table view cells/table views
4. Began with creating models for the JSON data
5. Created view models for the data, and then began to work on configuring the views in the table view cells 
6. Setup the table view data source and implemented the code to setup the table views in the view controllers
7. ran the API calls and made sure the JSON was being parsed correctly
8. manipulated the JSON to where I wanted it to go, and then updated the table view data source to load the views for the table view
9. from there customized the views on meal details view controller, made sure the passing of data between view controllers went smooth, and setup the ui search bar to search for meals specifically to their id
10. ran some tests to make sure the API response was proper in returning the specific object it was supposed to parse

Overall, I should have made more commits and pushes to the Git Hub respository to outline the above steps more clearly. The UI needs to be polished, but was instructed to not focus on that initially. Happy with the performance of the app and code base.
